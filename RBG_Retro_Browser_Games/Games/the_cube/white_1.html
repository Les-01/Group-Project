            <p>
                You awake in complete darkeness, as you open your eyes feel a pounding headache and the sense of disorientation washed over you, your heart begins to race as you realise you don't 
                know where you are, the last thing you rememebr was getting in your car and then...darkness. Your eyes start to adjust to the pitch black, your pupils dialating to let in as much 
                of the dim light as possible. Panic subsides into confusion?? You recognise this place, not as though you had been here before but the environemt is easily recogniseable, you have 
                awoken in a hedge maze, but not any hedge maze. This one seems different than a typical play thing for children and families. The air is thick with a nasty, musty smell your lungs 
                want to reject. The darkness seems to fight the light to envolope you in its cold embrace once again. The hedge walls tower over you unaturally creaking and moaning moving against 
                wind as if the maze itself was alive. You at the path that lays ahead of you, trapped and lost, suddenly you feel very cold, and very alone...
